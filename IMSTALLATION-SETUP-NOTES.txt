This file contains Wilbur's notes relating to the installation and setup of
CUDA-based learning software.


CUDA Installation
=================

First installed CUDA 9.1 (the most current release), but this did not work properly. Got information from DL4J developers that it must be exactly version 8.0.

2018-02-26
Installed CUDA Toolbox 8.0 (https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-80-ga2-download-archive) and patch (8.0.61.2). 
deviceQuery gave the following results:
